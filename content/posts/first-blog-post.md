or, a first timer's journey messing with static sites.

## What is Hugo?

I'll just [link](https://gohugo.io/) them for you and save you the trouble of having to read my own paraphrasing. I can't resist, however: it's essentially an open source service that helps you generate static websites. Documentation, blogs, portfolios, you name it. I was inspired by [Zoe's](https://zoriya.dev/) blog and wanted to create my own.

## The Goal

This blog post is essentially a letter to my past self. If I had this blog post maybe a few hours earlier, I could've saved myself a lot of headache.
## Installation

Currently, I'm working out of my Windows PC, so I'll go over this part assuming you are doing the same. If not, refer to this [site](https://gohugo.io/installation/).
- [ ]  Ensure that [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), a windows package manager (similar to brew on MacOS or pacman on Arch. I do not use Arch btw).
