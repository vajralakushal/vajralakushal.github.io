“No you don’t understand, I’m being *watched*.”

The man I was sitting next to on the bench outside my favorite shawarma place shifted slightly in his seat, but he made no further interruptions. The river across from us murmured, curious as to our conversation. Joggers ran by. A singular boat bobbed up and down right across from the bench. My eyes caught the fraying of the cardboard sign he held, a testament to its age. “Will listen to your problems if you pay me.” Glancing back through his matted beard and hair, I felt a strange sense of security and curiosity emanating from his eyes. 

“I’m telling you, this kid looks too much like me. I dug through old childhood photos and I swear it’s a doppelgänger.”

I motioned to pull my phone out, attempting to provide some semblance of proof for my ridiculous claims. The stranger waved his hand, dismissing it.

“I believe you. Carry on, why does he bother you?”

Relieved that finally someone didn’t doubt it, I took a deep breath in and proceeded in my story. “Do you mind?” I asked, pulling out my Marlboros. After a small shake of his head, I took a puff and snapped my lighter closed.

“I first noticed him on the anniversary of my ex and I a couple months ago. Then, I was more concerned than anything, a baby crawling around on the grass outside wherever I was. I thought I was just seeing things, but he seemed to age at an accelerated speed.”

I took a break for another drag. I offered a cig to the man, but he kindly and politely refused.

“So initially, I went out to try and get him to his parents. But every time I left the building I was in, he would disappear! Poof, vanish, like he wasn’t even there. As I walked back inside, though, I could *feel* him materialize. His eyes, dripping with innocent malevolence, locking back onto the back of my neck. Watching my every move. Staying outdoors or maintaining eye contact are the only ways I’m able to stay sane.”

I felt a phantom sensation tingle down my spine, and I paused to scratch my neck. I envied the crowds passing by. None of them had to care about anything other than their own problems. My eyes felt heavier than usual from the lack of sleep. 

“He doesn’t let me sleep. I know he’s out there, staring, watching. Am I being punished? I don’t know.”

“Hm. What would you be punished for?”

I stubbed my cigarette against the bench’s arm without thinking, and I winced apologetically. He probably slept here, and doesn’t appreciate the bit of mess I’m making. I debate whether I let out my regrets or not. Fuck it. I’m already at this point.

“My ex and I actually broke up after she got pregnant.”

“Oh? Usually that’s cause for celebration, I thought.”

“Yes, but I wasn’t ready. I’m not sure how to explain it. She was more of a filler in my life. Just a vessel to keep me feeling loved while I looked for someone I actually loved. I couldn’t raise a kid with her.”

“Ouch, man. You never thought about someone treating you like this too?”

“At the time, no. I was on top of the world, just received a promotion, and I didn’t envision myself actually settling down with her. Someone to keep me confident, keep me feeling desirable.

“She wanted to keep it, but I refused to participate and kept encouraging her to get rid of it. I didn’t care that it’d been 6 years of us together. I was just focused on myself. I’d come home and start arguments almost daily, and the last few months of our relationship were often spent away from each other.”

I felt the shame creeping up in my cheeks, and the tears slightly welling up as well. Family and friends were supportive about me not wanting to have kids yet, but I knew that what I did was wrong. I didn’t have the right to cry about it now. I refused the tissue I was offered and sniffled a bit.

“But anyways, about a year ago, she miscarried. Probably from the stress of it all. And I’ve never heard from her since. Is this it? Is this what I’m being punished for?”

“Fuck man. You’ve been through shit and you’ve put others through shit, huh. Let me see a picture of the kid again.”

“I’ll do you one better. He’s a poster I made, back when I thought it was just a neighborhood nuisance playing pranks on me.”

I explained the strange situation: the kid was able to be photographed, but no one could see him but me. All of my family and close acquaintances thought it was a Snapchat filter or something of the sorts, just a part of my annual elaborate April Fool’s day prank. I gave up trying to convince them after a week.

“Anyways, the kid is growing older and looking more like me. It’s scary. I’m not sure I like it. Why me? What am I being punished for? I feel needles on me at all times. I’m exhausted from being vigilant all the time. I’ve resorted to dragging my bed to the window so I can watch him and fall asleep from the temporary reprieve in exhaustion I’m blessed with.

“I can’t exactly stay outdoors all the time or look at him. I’ve asked for work from home for my job, and I’ve found a cafe with outdoor seating even in this cold to work from. But I’m tired. I want to stay in the warm indoors without being obligated to look at this kid. I can’t eat or go to the bathroom without multi tasking. I can’t do anything. I hate this. I hate this so much.

“Is this because I threw my friend under the bus when we both got caught cheating in college? Is this because I took all the credit and got a promotion instead of my coworker who deserved it?”

I buried my head in my hands and continued confessing my sins, each one being pulled out like intensely dense pieces of mucus in my sinuses. Felt better while I talked about it, but still left a bit of a hole inside me. 

I kept going. Then, I chose a moment to stop and look up. My fried nervous system couldn’t be bothered to get shocked. There he was, standing right in front of me. Eyes burnt black like coal. My cheekbones and ears. Nicole’s nose and smile. A man. I reached out a hand, and the apparition crumbled into dust in front of me.

I looked to my side and watched the man stand insouciantly, brushing the resulting black dust off his pants. 

“Was that… my son? My child?”

“Yes. What could have been.”

“Ah. Then just a punishment, for my sin?”

“You’ve committed a great many. That was just the start.”

I also stood up, dusting off the remnants of the cigarette off his bench. He grunted an appreciative sound.

Without a word, I followed the man to his boat. He got in effortlessly, but held out a hand to stop me from getting in.

“Where’s my money?”

“Oh. Yes, of course. Thanks for listening.”

I almost held out the money, but a doubt stopped me.

“What’s your name, if I can ask? I’m Will.”

“Charon. Like ‘care’ and ‘on’ together.”

“I see. Why is it two dollars? I thought it was only one coin?”

“Even us deities are not free from inflation.”

I laughed and held out the money, which he gracefully accepted. Compared to the past few months, I suppose death is preferable to this.

I clambered into the boat, and we rowed off into the distance.
