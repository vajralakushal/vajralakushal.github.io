or, a dusting of my little corner of the internet, and what the future beholds.

## A Recap

Hello. It's been a while since I've last written a post for my blog. It was, at this point, more than a year ago when I was so passionate about expanding my knowledge, working on new projects, and making a bit of a name for myself. Lots of things have happened since then. Let's do a quick recap.
- I used to not have a chair for my desk. I found that standing helped the creative juices flow better. It wasn't until I realized I stood for 10 hours in a row trying to fix a problem with my custom ChessGPT that I realized my feet did not appreciate the sacrifice on their part to let me continue to work and write at the pace I wanted.
- A few short stories have been written since then, the one I am most proud of saved on my notes app on my phone. Perhaps I'll share here one day.
- Many friends made, some friends lost, and existing connections grew stronger.
- A promotion at work! Lots more responsibility and lots more stakes assigned to me. I've learned a lot.
- I got my wisdom teeth out! The procedure kicked my ass, but I'm glad to have recovered from it.
- So so much more. If you'd like to know more or want to chat, please, shoot me a text or email and I'll reach back out to you.

## The Future

I was urged by a friend (whom I started writing blogs with, you should definitely [check him out](https://yfralam.github.io/). Be warned, some of it is a bit dense if you are not a Physics graduate student) to start writing blogs again. Having accountability is usually the most efficient when it is intrinsic, of course, but I greatly appreciate the external source, especially when it comes from a friend. 

I have come to the realization that I spend far too much time consuming and not enough time creating. I am grateful and privileged enough to live in a time period where I have both the technological means and the living conditions that allow me the opportunity to create. It seems a waste to not contribute whatever insights I have, original or not, back to the world through my corner of the internet. At the very least, if I am only helping my future self (re-setting up this blog post again was pretty easy because of what I had [written earlier](https://vajralakushal.github.io/posts/first-blog-post/first-blog-post/)), I will be satisfied. 

I want to learn. I want to grow. And, finally, I want to teach and pass on what I have learned to anyone else. I might incorporate my sports commentary or creative writing on here as well. That's okay too. I just want to get back into putting the pen to the paper (or rather, my fingertips to the keys) at a regular basis so that I am able to leave something that will be of use to anyone. 

Thanks for reading. I will be writing much more. Till next time.
